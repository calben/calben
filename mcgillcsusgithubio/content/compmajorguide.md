> Welcome to computer science at McGill! 
> Whether you're a prospective student, entering your first semester, or well on your way to graduation, this guide was made with students in mind to help you better navigate the programs offered at McGill. We're a very active community on and off campus with important ties to the industry and academia; we're constantly posting on our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mcgillcs/) about the latest technologies and academic concerns. Over the past few years, our current council has found that although there are many of us that know how to navigate the program, there'll always be a few left in the dark. This guide is our solution: we hope to bring all of our students to the same page and provide as much wisdom and knowledge as possible so as to make your journey as fun as possible!

# Choosing the Right Program
This text is an adapted version of the similar material provided by the School of Computer Science on the previous version of the cs.mcgill.ca website (2012 and earlier).
The [School of Computer Science](cs.mcgill.ca) offers a variety of programs both within the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science.

## Bachelor of Science, B.Sc. (Faculty of Science)

Most of our students choose a B.Sc. degree program. The B.Sc. degree is suitable for you if:
+ you are coming from a high school program outside of Quebec and you have enjoyed and succeeded in both mathematics and science; or
+ you are coming from any CEGEP program from within Quebec with the necessary science prerequisites.

There are four main programs available in the B.Sc. program:
+ Major in computer science (also available with a computer games option)
+ Honours in computer science
+ Major in software engineering
+ Honours in software engineering

Other programs include:
+ Major in computer science and biology
+ Major in computer science and physics
+ Major in computer science and mathematics
+ Major in computer science and statistics
+ Joint honours in computer science and statistics
+ Joint honours in computer science and mathematics

A major in computer science or software engineering provides a good general background in foundational and applied computer science. If focusing on software, you'll be exposed to more courses pertaining to the principled development of software. It contains ten core required courses, and three additional sets of courses from which to choose complementary courses; you can supplement your major with any 21 COMP credits at the 300-level or above.

If you are pursuing an honours major, you'll have fifteen required courses, two groups from which to choose complementary courses, and an additional 21 COMP credits to choose from at the 300-level or above. An Honours program gives you a deeper and more comprehensive education in computer science (and is particularly encouraged if you seek to attend graduate school) and requires a thesis. 

If you choose to study computer science within the B.Sc. program, you'll have much more flexibility when it comes to choosing your courses. You can easily supplement your studies with a minor in other faculties. 

If you decide on a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering, then you should choose "Faculty of Science" on your application form and choose the physical, earth, math and computer sciences group. The only exception is that the Computer Science and Biology Joint Major is in the Biological, Biomedical and Life Sciences group.

## Bachelor of Arts, B.A. (Faculty of Arts)

Some of the students associated with the School of Computer Science choose to complete a B.A. degree; in fact, for international students, the [cost of studying within the Faculty of Arts](http://www.mcgill.ca/student-accounts/tuition-charges/fallwinter-term-tuition-and-fees/undergraduate-fees) is approximately half that of studying in the Faculty of Science. It's possible to get quite a strong training in computer science within the B.A. degree program by taking both the computer science major concentration along with the supplementary minor in computer science. In terms of computer science content, this is almost the same at the B.Sc. major in computer science.

There are two main programs available in the B.A. program:
+ Major in computer science
+ Major in software engineering
+ Supplementary minor in computer science

The B.A. degree is suitable for you if your background does not include very much science, but you do have a good background in Mathematics and you have an interest and aptitude for logical reasoning.

## Bachelor of Arts and Science, B.A.& B.Sc.

The combined B.A. & Sc. degree, jointly offered by the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Arts is also an option available to our students. In the B.A. & Sc degree you can combine a 36-credit major concentration in computer science or software engineering with a major concentration or two minor concentrations from arts. For example, you could combine your computer science studies with areas such economics, anthropology, philosophy, linguistics, or geography.

Another option is the [Interfaculty or Honours program in Cognitive Science](http://www.mcgill.ca/cogsci/undergraduate). This is currently the only major and honours programs in cognitive science available at McGill (there is cognitive science minor in the B.Sc. program). You can choose a principle of area concentration, namely computer science.

## What is the difference between Computer Science and Computer Engineering?

The School of Computer Science (in the Faculty of Science) offers degrees in Computer Science, whereas the Faculty of Engineering offers a degree in Computer Engineering.

A computer science degree is more suitable for students more focused on the foundations of computer science and the development of software, or students who would like to combine their studies with mathematics or physics or with a wide variety of minors in science, management, marketing or arts.

A Computer Engineering degree is suitable for students who want core engineering courses and prefer to specialize more in computer hardware than in computer software. The engineering degree programs have significantly less flexibility for combined studies and fewer courses relating to software.

## What is the difference between Computer Science and Software Engineering?

The main difference is that the Software Engineering program contains a larger set of required courses concerning the principled design and development of software. It is also important to note that the computer science major also puts more emphasis on mathematics courses. 

If you are entering McGill from a high school, you may not have to decide which you prefer right away. You can start with the introductory courses that are common to both programs and then decide which you prefer.

If you are entering McGill from CEGEP, then you will be asked to specify a major when you apply. However, there is still quite a bit of flexibility and you will have some time to decide which you prefer. If you are accepted to McGill in the Faculty of Science you can change your major from Computer Science to Software Engineering (or vice versa) when you actually register at McGill, and you can even change it after you have taken some introductory courses.

## What is the difference between a B.Sc. and B.S.E. degrees in Software Engineering?

If you have decided that you would like to pursue a degree in software engineering, you still have to decide if you would prefer the B.Sc. in software engineering, offered through the School of Computer Science in the Faculty of Science, or the B.S.E. in software engineering offered through the Faculty of Engineering. What is the difference?

Both the B.Sc. and B.S.E programs in Software Engineering share a common core of software engineering courses, and you will be with the same students in many of these core courses. The B.Sc. degree is structured so that you have quite a bit of flexibility to take more courses about software or general computer science. You also have the option to follow 7 or 8 elective courses which gives you the opportunity to take further higher-level software courses or to pursue a minor program in another field. 

For students coming from CEGEP, the B.Sc. degree fits into 90 credits and can be completed in three years.

The B.S.E degree is structured so that in addition to courses specific to software engineering, you must also take many engineering-specific courses that are common to the engineering degrees, in addition to hardware courses.Students in the B.S.E. program must take required courses such as Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, Circuit Analysis, and Fundamentals of Signals and Systems. For students coming from CEGEP, the B.S.E. degree is 112-114 credits, to be completed in at least 3 1/2 years. Students graduating from this program are eligible for registration as professional engineers as the program has been accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.

Make sure you decide which program you would prefer when you apply to the university because switching between Faculties can be difficult.

## FAQ

> I'm currently registered for COMP 250 (or 251), 206 and 273 in the same semester. Is the workload manageable?
COMP 250 (or 251), 206 and 273 is completely manageable. If you are majoring in computer science or software engineering, you should get accustomed to the course load as early as possible because it doesn't get easier. If you take a look at the academic information provided on cs.mcgill.ca, you'll see that in the [recommended schedule](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/undergrad/schedule), if you're planning to do your major in three years depending on whether or not you're starting with 202, you will be needing to take quite a few computer science courses at the same time. Although yes, some classes are hard, if you really love what you're studying then it isn't so bad!
> The McGill website lists COMP ABC as a prerequisite for COMP DEF, but I'd really like to take COMP DEF next semester without having taken COMP ABC. What should I do? 
I would generally not recommend taking a course without the necessary prerequisites. Typically, prerequisites are in place for a reason and you should complete courses in order to ensure success. Before anyone decides to "skip" a prerequisite, it is recommended that the student look up the most recent final for the course and attempt it. It is also recommended the student take a look at the course syllabus and lecture material for self-study. If the student does not feel satisfied with their performance on the sample final exam or does not think that they could obtain higher than a B, then it is not recommended they skip the prerequisite. That being said, the professor teaching COMP DEF can decide to unregister all students without the necessary prerequisite.
